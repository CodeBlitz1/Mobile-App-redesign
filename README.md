Difference between Old and New Paytm app

Old 
1) In Old One first page or landing page have very number of advertisment
2) big gaps between main component like UPI money transfer then advertisment then another component travel & tickets
3) Profile section is in upper side which is old version
4) in profile section QR code is directly shows which is disgusting



New 
1) New one have very clear and easy to use interface no advertisement at all
2) no gaps between main components arrange in proper way
3) Navigation bar in bottom of the app in which profile section is arranged
4) QR code not shows directly, for QR Code differnt page will appear when we click on "Tap to see QR code"
